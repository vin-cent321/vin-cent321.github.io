<p>Hello class, my name is Vincent and I was born and raised in NY</p>
<p>but moved to Richmond this year for a slower paced and affordable lifestyle</p>
<p>with my partner. I graduated with a Bachelors Degree in Fine Arts at Hunter College</p>
<p>in NYC but would like to branch my creativity into the tech industry.</p>
<p>I’m currently a server but will be undergoing bar training soon.</p>
<p>My dog’s name is Nacho and I’ll talk about him constantly along with any pop culture </p>
<p>references that relate to sci-fi and fantasy!</p>
